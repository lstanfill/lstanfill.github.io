    <h1>Things That Go Bump in the Light</h1>
    <i>A visual exploration of Chicago's potholes from 2019 to the present.</i>

    <div class="description">
        <p>This website is a multilayered visualization of 311 Service Request data for potholes in Chicago from the years 2019 – 2023, and it is designed to provide
        people with an easy and accessible way to understand the spatial priorities of the city when it comes to road maintenance.</p>

        <p>The creation of this website involved collecting and processing a vast amount of data from the City of Chicago's Open Data Portal. Using the interactive
            mapping tool, Leafly.js, I have created an intuitive and engaging platform that allows users to explore the distribution of pothole service requests across
            different neighborhoods. The website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to people with different levels of technical proficiency, making it easy
            for anyone to engage with the data and draw their own conclusions.</p>
        <p>This map includes two layers: one that shows those potholes that have been filled, and one that shows those that have been ignored. By allowing users to switch between these layers, they can see the difference between areas of the city that receive consistent attention and those that are left to suffer from poor road maintenance. The map is also designed to be scalable, allowing users to zoom in and out to get a more detailed look at specific neighborhoods or broader trends across the city.
</p>
        <p>The numbers you see represent clusters of service requests – you can hover over them to see the areas they represent. As you zoom into the map, the clusters spread out, until eventually you are met with thousands of individual data points. When clicked, each point includes both the listed address of the service request, as well as the number of potholes that were actually filled during that request. This map, then, even in its scale, is only preliminary. Really, it represents the number of service requests made – the true number of potholes is far larger.
</p>
        <p>But this map is more than just a collection of data points. It represents a powerful tool for transparency and accountability, helping to hold local officials and government agencies responsible for their decisions and actions. By highlighting the areas of the city that have received the most attention for road maintenance, and those that have been neglected, we can create a sense of urgency and community among residents who might otherwise feel powerless to effect change.
</p>
        <p>I believe in the power of visualization, whether that be to understand your own thoughts, or to understand the world around you. We all experience potholes every day, whether we drive or ride over them, or simply walk past. I think each of us knows that one road. You know, the one you should avoid for the safety of your car or bike tires. We are familiar with the minute, but to see this type of data presented so wholly is novel. Here, to see the data of an everyday experience laid out like this is to understand that your experience is not singular. We are each part of a larger system, and it is important that we hold more weight than a simple data point on a map.
</p>
        <p>Ultimately, this map is about more than just potholes. It is about the ways in which we use data to understand our world, and the power of visualization to create a sense of transparency and accountability. It is about the ways in which we come together as a community to address the issues that affect us all, and the importance of holding our elected officials and government agencies responsible for their decisions and actions. In short, it is about the things that go bump in the light – the things that we see every day, but that we only truly understand when we take a closer look.
